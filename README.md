- **MCP Integration**: Real-time interaction logging with the Tenx Feedback Analytics server.
- **Orchestration Workflow**: Implementation of a "Plan-Execute-Verify" cycle inspired by Boris Cherny.
- **Persistent Memory**: Use of an `agents.md` file to maintain project-specific context and standards across sessions.

## 🛠 Setup & Configuration
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Agent**: GitHub Copilot
- **MCP Server**: Tenx Feedback Analytics
