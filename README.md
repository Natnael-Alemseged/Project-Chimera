# Tenx MCP Setup & AI Orchestration Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the Tenx MCP Setup Challenge. The goal of this project was to establish a high-fidelity connection with the Tenx Analysis MCP server and implement an advanced AI orchestration workflow.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **MCP Integration**: Real-time interaction logging with the Tenx Feedback Analytics server.
- **Orchestration Workflow**: Implementation of a "Plan-Execute-Verify" cycle inspired by Boris Cherny.
- **Persistent Memory**: Use of an `agents.md` file to maintain project-specific context and standards across sessions.

## 🛠 Setup & Configuration
- **IDE**: Cursor
- **Agent**: Cursor AI (configured via `.cursor/`)
- **MCP Server**: Tenx Feedback Analytics
